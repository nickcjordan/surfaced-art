### Bio (from his website — 96 words, fits 80–140 range)

> David was born and raised in Batavia, IL a western suburb of Chicago. He attended St. Olaf College where he received his B.A. in studio art and a concentration in Asian Studies. Upon graduating he was an artistic intern for the summer and fall of 2019 at Anderson Ranch Arts Center. He is a ceramic oriented mixed media artist and earned his MFA in Art from the University of Oklahoma. He is making playful objects exploring the Anthropocene through re-contextualizing the superfluous waste from our consumption within ceramic assemblages. He is working and pursuing his studio practice in Winooski, Vermont.

### Artist Statement (from Artaxis — longer form, for reference)

> Sparks fly when I encounter a vibrant fragment of waste rendered invisible to the average passerby. With an activated mind, I am drawn to the pops of color, values and forms littering our landscape. With these curious shards I amass a library of refuse. Through a repository of found and made objects, I craft a world that seeks to reveal the value of junk cohabitating with us. Working in the framework of play, my practice utilizes found objects and a multitude of processes rooted in the foundations of the ceramic medium. Through my assembly process I create playful ceramic sculptural objects that speak to our current moment of living in the Anthropocene.

### Bio (needs to be written — her artist statement is 240+ words, too long for platform bio)

Her full artist statement is rich and personal but exceeds the 80-140 word range. A condensed version for the platform bio:

> Karina Yanes is a Puerto Rican-Palestinian-Midwesterner ceramic artist based in Gainesville, FL. She creates and pieces together ceramic multiples, fragments, and tiles with collaged surfaces that hold onto traditions, icons, architecture, and language from her family's oral histories. Her practice highlights how cultures are carried on through repetition, daily gestures, and acts of care — reflected in her work through tedious, repetitive making and careful craft. Yanes holds an MFA in Studio Art from the University of Florida and a BA from Denison University. She has exhibited nationally and internationally, with forthcoming solo exhibitions at Art Center Sarasota and Morean Center for Clay.

**(89 words — within range. Should be reviewed/approved by the artist.)**

### Full Artist Statement (for reference — from her About page)

> Kefta seasoned with Goya, Umm Kulthum playing in the background as my mom speaks Spanish on the phone, colorful tatreez pillows on white couches, calling my uncles "amo" and my aunts "titi," my grandma on her prayer mat while my grandmi shouts "ay Dios mio!" I couldn't necessarily identify which components belonged to which culture.
>
> My work is a glimpse into an intangible world that I have always known. Many of us who are mixed carry this world with us; each of ours is different, but they all run parallel to one another. Growing up as a Puerto Rican-Palestinian-Midwesterner has always left me living in this world, at the intersection of three cultures. [...]

**Note:** Available items are fabricated for seed purposes. Sold items are real. Images can be reused from the sold Olive Oil Bowl thumbnails for the available bowl listings. The Collaged Tile listings are fabricated based on her exhibition work style — images would need to be sourced from her Work series pages or provided by the artist.

## Data Gaps (updated)

- **Packed dimensions/weight** — use placeholders for seed (bowls ~8"×8"×5" packed, ~2 lbs; tiles ~10"×10"×4" packed, ~3 lbs)
- **Cover image** — homepage image not extractable. Reuse one of the Work series images or her headshot as fallback
- **Process photos** — Work series pages have installation/process images but URLs not extractable. Reuse what's available or source from artist

### Bio (from makomud.com/CONTACT-INFO — 68 words, slightly under 80-140 range)

> Macayla is a ceramic artist pursuing an MFA at The University of Iowa. They received a BFA from The University of Arkansas with an emphasis in Ceramics and have held teaching positions at multiple community studios in New York City. Their functional vessels are a practice of self-reflection and translation of memory. The fantastical surface drawings blur and blend as the glazes move together to achieve a dreamy quality. By letting go of refinement, their pottery is imaginative while staying rooted in historical contexts of clay and illustration.

**Note:** This is from their own site (68 words). Slightly under the 80-140 suggested range but per the updated platform guidance, this is acceptable. They use they/them pronouns.

**Email:** macaylasandusky@gmail.com

### Profile Photo

makomud.com has images on the Contact/Info page but they rendered as empty image tags — the Cargo site template doesn't expose image URLs in text. Would need to be provided directly by artist.

**Note:** All listings fabricated for seed. Images would need to be sourced from their site (if screenshots are possible) or provided directly by the artist.
