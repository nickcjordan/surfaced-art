## Listings — Available (from /shop)

All items are `type: standard`, `category: ceramics`, `medium: stoneware` (confirmed from product detail pages).
Dimensions are artwork dimensions parsed from titles (L × W × H in inches).
**Packed dimensions and packed weight are NOT available on the website — must be collected from the artist.**

Typical listing description from her site: *"Functional lidded jar made with stoneware and glaze in my Iowa City home studio."* This is representative of what real artists actually write — a concise sentence about materials and origin, not a multi-paragraph story. See platform implications note at bottom.

### Listing Images

Each listing has approximately **2 images** — a primary view and one additional angle. This was confirmed from the product detail page for "Peachy Cream Box" which showed `112125-36.jpg` (primary) and `112125-37.jpg` (alternate angle). Image filenames follow a date-based numbering convention (MMDDYY-##).

Thumbnail URLs on Squarespace follow this pattern:

```
https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5b15f1e52487fd2f51e73cf8/[image-id]/[filename].jpg
```

These would need to be downloaded and re-uploaded to S3 for the seed. The shop overview page only surfaces the primary thumbnail; full image sets require fetching each individual product page.

## Data Gaps — Must Collect from Artist

The following fields required by the data model are **not available** on the website and need to be gathered directly from Abbey:

1. **Packed dimensions** (L × W × H) for each listing — the shipping box size
2. **Packed weight** (lbs) for each listing — the total shipping weight
3. **Origin zip code** — recently moved from Iowa City to Denver. Confirm current shipping location
4. **Process photos / studio images** — her portfolio series pages likely have great process content but need to be fetched from specific URLs or she can provide images directly
5. **Profile photo preference** — confirm if the bio page headshot is the one she wants used
6. **Cover image preference** — confirm which series image she wants as her banner

## Platform Implications — Listing Description & Image Expectations

Real-world data from Abbey's shop challenges two assumptions carried over from the Urn Studios reference doc.

### Description Length

The Vision doc and Urn Studios reference recommend **40-100 words** for listing descriptions. Abbey's actual descriptions are closer to **15-20 words** — a single sentence covering materials and studio origin. Example:

> *"Functional lidded jar made with stoneware and glaze in my Iowa City home studio."*

This is likely representative of how most working artists describe functional pieces. A ceramic box doesn't need a 100-word backstory. The platform should:

- **Provide word count guidance as a suggestion, not a minimum.** "A sentence or two about materials, process, or inspiration" is better guidance than a word count floor.
- **Not enforce a minimum character/word count on the description field.** Artists will skip listing pieces rather than invent filler copy.
- The 40-100 word range may still be useful as a *hint* shown in the UI, but the field should accept shorter entries without friction.

### Image Count

The Vision doc recommends multiple angles (front, back, base, detail shots). Abbey's listings have **2 images each** — a primary view and one additional angle. The platform should:

- **Require a minimum of 1 image** (hard gate — can't publish without at least one photo).
- **Recommend additional angles as guidance, not a requirement.** Show tips like "Listings with multiple angles tend to sell faster" — aspirational, not blocking.
- Photography guidance (COO content) should frame multi-angle shots as best practice, not a prerequisite.

**Action: Update the Vision doc and Build Order to reflect these as soft recommendations rather than implied minimums.**

## Notes for Seed Script Implementation

- All prices already converted to cents in the tables above
- Artwork dimensions parsed from the listing titles (the "4.5 × 5.5 × 4" format). These are reliable since she formats them consistently
- Medium confirmed as **stoneware** from product detail pages
- For seed purposes, packed dimensions can use placeholder values (artwork dims + 2" per side, weight estimated at 2-4 lbs depending on size) with a TODO to replace with real values before launch
- The shop has 3 subcategories: Boxes, Candlesticks, Vases — these map well to a future tag system but all fall under `ceramics` in our category enum
- Typical listing description: *"Functional lidded jar made with stoneware and glaze in my Iowa City home studio."* — use as-is for seed; she can expand later
- Each listing has ~2 images (primary + one angle). Use for seed as-is
- Her CV is extensive. I included 36 entries; you may want to trim to the most impactful ~15-20 for the seed depending on how the profile page renders
- Abbey is the founding advisor (SIL) — she is artist #1 for seeding
