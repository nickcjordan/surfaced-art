      "prompt": "Product photograph of: \"Indigo Scarf, Itajime\". Silk scarf dyed with natural indigo using the itajime (shaped-resist) technique. Geometric patterns emerge from folding and clamping the silk between wooden blocks before dyeing. The result is a precise, symmetrical pattern in gradations of blue. Medium: silk, natural indigo, itajime shibori. Shot from a three-quarter angle to show depth and dimension. Clean neutral background. Professional product photography. Show texture and surface detail."

The carbon trapped in the glaze crackle creates dark lines on the white surface, evoking the surface of the moon. Not watertight — intended as a sculptural object. Medium: raku-fired stoneware, white crackle glaze. Shot on a clean, neutral background (white or light grey). Professional product photography with soft, even lighting. Show the full piece straight-on. High resolution, accurate color."
